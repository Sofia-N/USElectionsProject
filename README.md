# 2016 US Elections Statistical Analysis

###### In this projet I make a statistical analysis using supervised and unsupervised statistical learning methods for the 2016 US elections.

###### The data used refer to the elections for the candidated to both parties (Democrats and Republicans) for the presidential elections of 2016. The data contain information about the socioeconomic characteristics of the US counties as well as the votes for the candidates. 
###### The analysis is split in two parts. For the first part, which involves classification we are interested to find whether Trump got more than 50% of the votes at each county for the Republicans, while using as explanatory variables the socio-economic characteristics of these counties. We aim at creating a predictive model able to classify if Trump got more than half the votes at each county. Two distinct methods where used, k-NN classification and Desicion trees, for which we assessed how good the predictions were.
###### In the second part of the analysis, cluster analysis was performed. Specifically, the socio-economic variables were split into two groups, the demographic and the economic related ones. Here the "demographic related" variables were used to cluster the counties and the rest ("economic related") were used to describe the clusters found previously. The method chosen to perform cluster analysis was K-means.
